  <p>Founded in 2022, Character Issues is a dynasty league started up by three friends with a keen interest in the NFL and showcasing their incredible knowledge.</p>
  <p>Once the idea to set up a dynasty league was born we each set off scurrying for league members from various sources and a rag tag group of UK NFL fans was finalised.</p>
  <p>Following the startup draft auction an eclectic collection of teams with differing (or dithering, in some cases) styles and ambitions were created and ever since then through trade offers good and bad the league has really started to hit it's stride.</p>
  <p>In year 2, a weekly review is issued to provide a comprehensive rundown of the week's matchups, dodgy dealings and top available players.</p>
  <p>Yes, there is a monetary prize pot, the ultimate prize is bragging rights.</p>
